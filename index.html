                                            Hello, good morning. My name is Jakub Hrozek. I work in the Red Hat identity management team,
                                            mostly on the SSSD project along with Sumit. Unlike most of you, I'm not a Samba developer. As a
                                            matter of fact, I've only opened the Samba server code a handful of times. Therefore, this talk
                                            is not about Samba itself.

                                            It's about maintaining the Samba libraries as independent packages in Fedora and RHEL. It's about our
                                            experience using the Samba libraries in a large project that is totally independent on Samba. These
                                            two topics are first part of the presentation, maybe a bit less technical than the rest. Then,
                                            I'd I'd like to show you an interesting way we've used the Samba libraries that are not present
                                            in Samba itself, to provide access control using windows group policies. And finally, some ways
                                            we'd like to extend the LDB with a new back end and make it easier to add new back ends in the future.

                                            To put the talk into context, let me very briefly introduce SSSD. SSSD is a system deamon that,
                                            with the help of Name Service Switch and PAM modules, provides access to users and groups stored
                                            remotely, in centralized databases. Currently SSSD supports LDAP for both id and auth, Kerberos
                                            for authentication.  SSSD also supports FreeIPA and Active Directory a client, to support the
                                            domain member role. It's a fairly large project, totalling around 220.000 lines of code, the vast
                                            majority being written in C.

                                            Because SSSD was started by Samba developers (Simo and Sumit), it was a heavy users of libraries
                                            originating in Samba for a long time. We use talloc, tevent, ldb and tdb in mostly predictable ways.
                                            Starting with the 1.12 version, we're also using the ndr and the libsmbclient libraries to fetch
                                            and use GPOs to provide access control. And we also started using most of the libraries that are
                                            now also available separately under the cwrap.org umbrella to provide better unit tests. Because the
                                            cwrap libraries originate at Samba and made their way back to the Samba tree, they are worth mentioning.

					<h2>Samba libraries in Fedora/RHEL</h2>
                                        <p>In Fedora/RHEL, the separate libraries have been maintained by the SSSD maintainer, not the Samba maintainer</p>
                                        <p>Historical development. Let's blame Simo!</p>
                                        <p>For the most part, it's been a smooth ride, but..</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            Funnily, even though I'm not a Samba developer, I'm the person who maintains the Samba libraries
                                            in Fedora and RHEL. This is for historical reasons, because Simo used to be both Samba maintainer
                                            and SSSD maintainer in RHEL and even after he moved on, the Samba libraries were always maintained
                                            by whoever owned SSSD at that time. It may not sound like the most logical solution, often I get
                                            pinged by Samba developers to include a fix or build a new package to fix some of their problems
                                            that I don't understand, but at least I can give you an insight on what it is like to maintain the
                                            libraries without any Samba knowledge. For the most part, it has been easy, but there are things
                                            that can be improved.

					<h2>Maintaining Samba libraries</h2>
                                        <p>As a maintainer, I care about changes</p>
                                        <p>Is this package version safe for a stable Fedora?</p>
                                        <p>Is it a bugfix-only release or are there new features?</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            As a maintainer in Fedora and RHEL, I care about changes between the last releases. I need to
                                            decide if a new version can only be included in the Fedora development version or also in the stable
                                            versions. Or if there are any changes that should be cherry-picked and backported even to a RHEL release.
                                            Currently Samba doesn't make it easy.

					<h2>Using Samba libraries</h2>
                                        <p>SSSD was started by Simo<p>
                                        <p>More developers are hired to work on the SSSD</p>
                                        <p>Documentation is important in getting them up to speed</p>
                                        <p>Result - tevent and talloc tutorials</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            Documentation and tracking changes is also the only comment about how the Samba libraries are used
                                            that I have. Even though SSSD is an external consumer, we didn't have many issues in the beginning
                                            with the lack of documentation. Several developers already had experience with Samba and the others
                                            started about the same time, so we learned stuff that was crucial but not documented anywhere. But
                                            the SSSD team grows and changes and we had to teach new developers who had no prior experience
                                            with Samba. To make that easier and not repeat ourselves, developers from our team submitted or
                                            tutored documentation for talloc and tevent in a tutorial form. But as more functionality is added
                                            to the libraries, we need to make sure the tutorials reflect the current best practices and are
                                            up to date.

                                            If we take a look at talloc, the homepage takes us straight to Doxygen documentation. There
                                            are no release notes or changelog. In the tarball, there is a NEWS file, but the last record is
                                            from 2007. It's actually required to look into the git history to find out what changed, but
                                            even that it not as easy as it could be, because you need to know where the libraries are in the
                                            first place. Ideally, navigating to the talloc/tevent homepage should list all the information
                                            that developers and maintainers need.

					<h2>Example - cwrap.org libraries</h2>

                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            After we checked out talloc, we can compare that with another piece of code originating from Samba
                                            as well, the cwrap.org libraries. Even though the cwrap libraries live in a separate git tree now,
                                            they've been merged back to Samba..I guess that's how Samba rolls.. In comparison with talloc and
                                            tevent, the cwrap libraries are much easier for an outside consumer like SSSD to use. The cwrap.org
                                            site has a NEWS section and each tarball has a changelog file that lists what has changed since
                                            last time. If that is not descriptive enough, it's easy to view the change history for every
                                            wrapper separately. For beginners, there is a lwn.net article and other tutorials on the Internet.
                                            I'm a bit biased here, because I've been working on the cwrap project with Andreas, mostly on the resolv_wrapper, but
                                            I looked at the code and the libraries even before, maybe 2 years ago. But until the project was
                                            more separate, the libraries were just too hard to use. For me, cwrap is a role model in how the
                                            Samba libraries should be. The difference is not in the code, it's how the code is presented and
                                            maintained.

					<h1>The Samba libraries rock</h1>
                                        <p>The libraries Samba produces are already great</p>
                                        <p>With a little more polish, they could be awesome</p>
                                        <p>Let's discuss how we can work together</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            I've been ranting about Samba libraries for a couple of slides now. I really don't want it to look
                                            like I'm not happy with the libraries -- I am. SSSD wouldn't be possible without the libraries
                                            that we consume and both talloc and tevent are libraries that more projects should be using. I
                                            just think that with just a little more effort on polish and paying attention to how the code is
                                            consumed and distributed, the libraries could be used by many more projects. Especially talloc
                                            could be used more, memory management is something every C project struggles with. I have a couple
                                            of suggestions and wishes that I'd like to present and discuss. Maybe not all of them are realistic
                                            or would be welcome by Samba, but let's take a look.

                                        <p>git-shortlog or a digest to samba-technical is perfectly fine</p>
                                        <p>Keep the documentation up-to-date</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            The biggest help for us would be to know what are the changes when a new release comes out. We
                                            don't need a detailed list describing every commit, but a several bullet points listing the fixes
                                            or new API calls would be nice.  Maybe this is something we could help with -- send an e-mail to the
                                            samba-technical list a day before the release and we can craft a simple changelog file and check if
                                            any of the changes should be reflected in the documentation of the libraries. I know this work is
                                            not required for the core Samba server, you know your libraries well, so I realize this is a part
                                            where we need to help. Feel free to find me after the talk to discuss how, or just write me an e-mail.

                                            If I can ask for even more, the best for us would be to be able to see all the changes. I understand
                                            it's not required in Samba to send all patches to the mailing list for review and it probably
                                            makes sense given the volume of changes in Samba. But from time to time, there are discussions
                                            on samba-technical about starting using a code-review tool like Gerrit. Maybe enabling external
                                            consumers to track changes and participate in changes to the libraries could be another point for
                                            adding the code review tool. From my point of view, and I guess and don't know the historical reasons
                                            but for us, it would be best if there was a separate git tree with the libraries or git submodule.
                                            I understand that it's a bit sensitive topic, but it would definitely help make the tools better
                                            consumable for outsiders and maybe even attract more developers and users. Last but not least,
                                            advertise your work! The libraries are great, more people should know about them.

					<h1>Access control using Group Policy Objects</h1>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            In the second part of the talk, let's take a look at one new feature of SSSD 1.12 that we implemented
                                            using a samba library that we didn't use before.

					<h2>Access control with SSSD </h2>
                                        <p>SSSD has several options for access control</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Allow everything</li>
                                            <li>Allow users that match a filter</li>
                                            <li>Allow users present in an ACL</li>
                                            <li><b>Use Active Directory GPOs</b></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            We already have a few ways to control access control in SSSD. The easiest access control is just to
                                            allow everything :-). It's possible to configure an LDAP-like filter that allows users who match
                                            the filter. Or it's possible to set a list of usernames or groupnames that are allowed. But all
                                            these methods are client-side only, in enterprise environment you normally want to define the access
                                            control policies at one place. And if SSSD is acting as a Windows domain member, it's most natural
                                            to use the GPOs for access control, just like you would with a Windows client machine.  This is
                                            a feature we added to sssd 1.12 and we used a samba library, libsmbclient to accomplish this feature.

					<h2>Using GPOs for access control</h2>
                                        <p>Group Policy can only be used for access control with SSSD</p>
                                        <p>The rest is not SSSD's domain</p>
                                        <p>But the code is a bit extensible (Sudo?)</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            In Windows, Group policies can be used to manage pretty much anything in a Windows domain, ranging from access
                                            to network shares to a desktop background. SSSD's system interface is NSS and PAM module, therefore
                                            we limit the functionality to access control only. Some functinality that could in theory be used
                                            by SSSD can be added later, maybe Sudo would be a good candidate.

					<h2>Configuring GPO for access control (In Windows)</h2>

                                        <p>Configure "User Rights assignments" in the "Group Policy Management Editor"</p>
                                        <p>This is all Windows-specific terminology</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            In Windows, configuring the GPO based access control is two-step process. You'd first create and link the GPO
                                            to the OU or domain it applies to and then configure the user rights assignments in another UI. The key point
                                            is that this is all windows terminology that doesn't apply on Linux machines SSSD runs.

					<h2>LogonRights to PAM services translation</h2>
                                        <p>Windows uses LogonRights for access control</p>
                                        <p>Linux uses PAM services</p>
                                        <p>SSSD has default mappings and allows custom mappings in configuration</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            So the linux client SSSD runs at needs to do translation from the Windows-style aceess control that
                                            is done using LogonRights to the Linux-style access control that is done using PAM services. To
                                            do that, SSSD has several default mappings of Windows LogonRights and allows the configuration to
                                            be changed and overriden. The default mappins are supposed to be useful for most environments --
                                            for example the RemoteInteractiveLogonRight maps onto SSH and InteractiveLogonRight maps onto services
                                            like GDM or KDM. There's more mappins, all are listed in the sssd-ad man page. With this mapping, 
                                            the logon rights configured earlier on the server are translated into client-side access control
                                            rules. This is how the GPO access control feature works from user perspective, let's take a look how they
                                            are coded up.

					<h1>Extending LDB with an MDB back end</h1>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            In the last part of the presentation, I'd like to show you my hobby project, which is a new
                                            back end for the LDB database that uses the LMDB key-value database as the underlying storage.
                                            While most of the LDB operations are there, not all functionality required by Samba and provided
                                            by the TDB back end was implemented, so the LMDB back end is still a bit of work in progress.

					<h2>Why do the work?</h2>
                                        <p>A very frequent complaint about SSSD is "it's slow"</p>
                                        <p>SSSD uses its cache heavily due to its architecture</p>
                                        <p>In some cases (saving large groups), the cache was taking a lot of time</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            Why did I start all this work? One complaint we're getting a lot from our users is that SSSD is
                                            slow. When we started looking into the performance results, we found out that writing entries to the
                                            database was sometimes the reason for the slowness. Even though some use-cases could be improved
                                            by refactoring SSSD code, for instance to perform fewer cache writes, the database performance
                                            was still not optimal. Around that time, I heard the idea of using LMDB as an underlying store
                                            for LDB. It seemed like it could help our problem, but also seemed like a fun project to hack on!

					<h2>LMDB 101</h2>
                                        <p>LMDB is the rock star of key-value stores</p>
                                        <p>Written by Howard Chu (Symas/OpenLDAP)</p>
                                        <p>The API usage resembles Berkeley DB</p>
                                        <p>See any of Howard Chu's presentations to learn more (FOSDEM, LDAPCon, ...)</p>

                                            At the same time, LMDB was being introduced on many conferences, blogs and elsewhere. LMDB was
                                            written for OpenLDAP by Howard Chu and he made a really good job making sure that the developer
                                            community was aware of his work. The advantages of LMDB are performance (L stands for Lightning),
                                            while retaining ACID semantics and compact codebase. API-wise, LMDB is close to Berkeley DB.
                                            Given that the main driver for starting the work was performance, it's prudent to take a look
                                            at some benchmarks to see if it makes sense to implement the LMDB back end.

					<h2>LMDB benchmarks</h2>
                                        <p>Benchmarks comparing different DB engines are available at <a href="http://symas.com/mdb/">http://symas.com/mdb/</a></p>
                                        <p>Pretty graphs!</p>
                                        <p>LMDB wins pretty much all the time</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            The LMDB homepage lists several benchmarks for different workloads, comparing databases like BDB,
                                            LevelDB etc. Most of the results are visualized into nice graphs, but at present, TDB is not
                                            included there directly.  However, Howard Chu extended the LevelDB's db_bench benchmark tool with
                                            additional database engines, including TDB.

                                            I compiled the db_bench tool and ran the test on my laptop. It's important to run the tests with
                                            a non-default TESTDIR to make sure the tests run on a real disk partition and not /tmp which is
                                            a tmpfs on modern Linux distributions. In all tests, MDB was much faster, the two tests I chose
                                            are those where TDB was the closes to MDB in terms of performance. However, these benchmarks were
                                            created by the author of LMDB, maybe it makes sense to take a look at some by Samba team..

					<h2>The implementation of ldb_mdb</h2>
                                        <p>Both TDB and LMDB are key-value stores</p>
                                        <p>Much of the work started as s/tdb/mdb/</p>
                                        <p>But lot of the code could be shared</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            Because both TDB and LMDB are key-value stores, the API is a bit similar. When I started the work,
                                            I mostly copied code, refactored it as I went a bit, but it was apparent there is a lot of code
                                            duplication between the tdb and lmdb back ends. Also, while there is an SQLite and LDAP back end
                                            in the ldb source, too, realistically only TDB is being used. As a result, the TDB back end implements
                                            lot of logic that any new back end needs to implement to be usable, but that is not strictly tied
                                            to TDB.

					<h2>Extensible code</h2>
                                        <p>Databases are not one-size fits all</p>
                                        <p>LMDB seems nice for server-side read environments, but some environments might prefer FooDB or BarDB</p>
                                        <p>LevelDB anyone?</p>
                                        <p>RocksDB anyone?</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            While the preliminary testing results seem to indicate that LMDB is nice and could bring us great speed
                                            benefits, some environments might prefer a different database, maybe the workload would be different.
                                            Pretty much by accident I stumbled upon RocksDB when working on the LMDB back end. </aside>

					<h2>Shared code</h2>
                                        <p>Goal: Create the ldb_mdb back end on top of generic keyval utilities</p>
                                        <p>Secondary goal: Reuse generic LDB functions in the modules. Some LDB functions were created later than the tdb backend</p>
                                        <p>Shared code could be used also the tdb back end</p>
                                        <aside class="notes">
                                            For all these reasons it makes sense to try to split the code that doesn't strictly require TDB
                                            into its own module and make it usable not only by the TDB back end, but any key-value store.
                                            Additionally, there are private functions in the TDB back end that perform exactly the same function
                                            as public LDB functions that were just added later (ldb_msg_add, ldb_msg_remove_element). Perhaps
                                            some could be substituted for the common LDB functions and make the code smaller.

                                            My work in progess splits several generic modules out of the TDB back end into the common directory. For
                                            example, any new back end would probably use tevent in the same manner as TDB uses to establish requests
                                            with timeouts and error handling. All search requests need a way to filter only the requested attributes
                                            for example or all modify operations need the same common logic to create a resulting ldb_message after a mod.
                                            I split all these into modules and wrote unit tests for these in the process. The module interface might not be
                                            ideal and I need your help reviewing them!
